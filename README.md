## Features

1. The Family Tree **automatically arranges** families based on with inner family advantages.
2. **Support for Complex Couples** - Handle complex family structures such as divorces, shared kids, and other intricate relationships.
3. **Maintained Generations** - Generations are visually maintained, providing a clear distinction between different family layers.
4. **Color-Coded Family Edges** - Each family edge is assigned a unique color, helping you distinguish between different branches of your family.
5. **Non-Colliding Edges with Offset** - To enhance the clarity of your family tree, edges are arranged to avoid collisions.
6. **Portrait Image support** - Include images to personalize your family tree.
7. Very configurable

```tsx
import FamilyTree from 'reactflow-family-tree'
import { RawFamilyMember, buildFamilyAndRelations, RawFamilyRelation } from 'reactflow-family-tree'
const App = () => {
  const familyData = {
    familyMembers: [
      {
        id: '1',
        data: {
          title: 'John Doe',
          titleBgColor: 'rgb(0, 0, 128)',

    familyRelations: [
      {
        relationType: 'Partner',
        prettyType: 'Spouse',
        fromId: '1',

  // Prepare the data
  const [familyMembersRecord, familyRelationsRecord] = buildFamilyAndRelations(
    familyData.familyMembers as RawFamilyMember[],
    familyData.familyRelations as RawFamilyRelation[],
  )
  const rootMember = familyMembersRecord['4']
  return (
